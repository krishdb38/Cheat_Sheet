Primer is a short, single-stranded DNA sequence used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.
In the PCR method, a pair of primers is used to hybridize with the sample DNA and define the region of the DNA that will amplified.


Primer refers to a small set of nucleotides of DNA, typically 18 to 24 base pairs in length.
And a primer can be used for a multitude of other experimental process.
You can use promer in PCR to target a locus to allow for amplification for further analysis.

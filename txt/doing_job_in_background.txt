nohup 없이 echo 실행
echo hello
→ 터미널 화면에 출력된다.

nohup echo helo            # output file save as nohup.out
nohup echo hello > 1.txt   #output save as 1.txt
nohup echo hello > /dev/null  #Output will not saved

python filename.py & #Running in the background
#while running like above the program will exit after you exiting the terminal

nohup python filename.py & 
#the result in print () will be saved to nohup.out file name

가끔 ssh 터미널을 종료할 경우 nohup으로 실행중인 프로그램도 종료되는 경우가 있는데
종료 전에 disown 명령어를 통해 해당 프로세스를 ssh세션에서 분리한 다음
로그아웃 하면 계속 돌릴 수 있다.

insertion and deletion variants (indels)

##BG ZIp
 ## bg zip is requirted to annotate with dbsnp
bgzip -c file.vcf > file.vcf.gz
tabix -p vcf file.vcf.gz

## Tabix is always importanttabix -p vcf






## To Annotate VCF file with rsid 
# use bcftools annotate --help for more details
bcftools annotate -a (annotations_file _ ) -c (Column_list_We want Id) -o (OutPut File Standard File Format)
